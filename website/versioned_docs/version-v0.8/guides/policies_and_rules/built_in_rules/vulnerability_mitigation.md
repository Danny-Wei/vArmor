# Vulnerability Mitigation
These rules are used to mitigate specific vulnerabilities.

### `cgroups-lxcfs-escape-mitigation`

Mitigate cgroups & lxcfs escape.

:::note[Description]
If users mount the host's cgroupfs into a container or use lxcfs to provide a resource view for the container, there may be a risk of container escape in both scenarios. Attackers could manipulate cgroupfs from within the container to achieve container escape.

This rule can also be used to defend against [CVE-2022-0492](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cve-2022-0492-cgroups/) vulnerability exploitation.
:::

:::info[Principle & Impact]
AppArmor Enforcer prevents writing to：
* `/**/release_agent`
* `/**/devices/device.allow`
* `/**/devices/**/device.allow`
* `/**/devices/cgroup.procs`
* `/**/devices/**/cgroup.procs`
* `/**/devices/task`
* `/**/devices/**/task`

BPF Enforcer prevents writing to：
* `/**/release_agent`
* `/**/devices.allow`
* `/**/cgroup.procs`
* `/**/devices/tasks`

* AppArmor
* BPF

### `runc-override-mitigation`

Mitigate the ability to override runc to escape.

:::note[Description]
The rule is designed to mitigate vulnerabilities such as [CVE-2019-5736](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gxmr-w5mj-v8hh) that exploit container escape by tampering with the host machine's runc.
:::

:::info[Principle & Impact]
Disallow writing to `/**/runc` files.

:::tip[Supported Enforcer]
* AppArmor
* BPF

### `dirty-pipe-mitigation`

Mitigate the 'Dirty Pipe' exploit to escape.

:::note[Description]
The rule is designed to defend against attacks exploiting the [CVE-2022-0847 (Dirty Pipe)](https://dirtypipe.cm4all.com/) vulnerability for container escape. You can use this rule to harden container, before upgrading or patching the kernel.

Note: While this rule may cause issues in some software packages, blocking the syscall usually does not have an effect on legitimate applications, since use of this syscall is relatively rare.
:::

:::info[Principle & Impact]
Disallow calling `splice` syscall.
