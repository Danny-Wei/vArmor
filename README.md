vArmor is a cloud-native container sandbox system. It leverages Linux's [AppArmor LSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor), [BPF LSM](https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/prog_lsm.html) and [Seccomp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp) technologies to implement enforcers. It can be used to strengthen container isolation, reduce the kernel attack surface, and increase the difficulty and cost of container escape or lateral movement attacks. You can leverage vArmor in the following scenarios to provide sandbox protection for containers within a Kubernetes cluster.
* In multi-tenant environments, hardware-virtualized container solutions cannot be employed due to factors such as cost and technical conditions.
* You want to enhance the security of critical business containers, making it more difficult for attackers to escalate privileges, escape, or laterally move.
* When high-risk vulnerabilities are present but immediate remediation is not possible due to the difficulty or lengthy process of patching, vArmor can be used to mitigate the risks (depending on the vulnerability type or exploitation vector) to block or increase the difficulty of exploitation.

*Note:* 
*<br />- The core of security defense lies in balancing risks and benefits, transforming uncontrollable risks into controllable costs by choosing different types of security boundaries and defense technologies.*
*<br />- runc + vArmor does not provide an isolation level equivalent to that of hardware virtualization containers (such as Kata Containers and other lightweight virtual machines). If you require a high-intensity isolation solution, please consider using hardware virtualization containers for compute isolation, and utilize CNI's NetworkPolicy for network isolation.*

**vArmor Features:**
* **Cloud-Native**. vArmor follows the Kubernetes Operator design pattern, allowing users to harden specific workloads by manipulating the [CRD API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/). This approach enables sandboxing of containerized microservices from a perspective closely aligned with business needs.
* **Multiple Enforcers**. vArmor abstracts AppArmor, BPF, and Seccomp as enforcers, supporting their use individually or in combination. This enables enforcing access control on container file access, process execution, network outbound, syscalls, and more.
* **Allow-by-Default**. vArmor currently focuses on supporting this model, where only explicitly declared behaviors will be blocked, which effectively minimizes performance impact and enhances usability. Besides, it supports auditing violations, and these violations can also be allowed rather than blocked.
* **Built-in Rules**. vArmor features a range of built-in rules ready to use out of the box. They are designed for the Allow-by-Default security model, eliminating the need for expertise in security profile creation.
* **Behavior Modeling**. vArmor features a range of built-in rules ready to use out of the box. They are designed for the Allow-by-Default security model, eliminating the need for expertise in security profile creation.
* **Deny-by-Default**. vArmor is capable of using allowlist profiles to harden workloads and provide a more user-friendly approach to develop and manage profiles.


vArmor was created by the **Elkeid Team** of the endpoint security department at ByteDance. And the project is still in active development.
